LIX of Danish Speeches
========
The lix.csv file contains the LIX of speeches given by the Danish Prime Minister when opening the Danish Parliament and on January the 1st and by the Queen of Denmark on New Year's Eve. LIX is a measure of how difficult a text is to understand developed by Swedish scholar Carl-Hugo Björnsson. It is computed as follows:

LIX = A / B + (C * 100) / A, where

A is the number of words,

B is the number of sentences, and

C is the number of long words (more than 6 letters).
